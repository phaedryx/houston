# Cops
# ---------------------------------------------

#################### Bundler ###############################

# I would like to turn this on because I think that every gem should be
# commented, but it doesn't allow comments on the same line as the gem
# declaration and having 3 lines per gem (comment, gem, blank) gets way to long.
Bundler/GemComment: { Enabled: false }

# We may try and organize the Gemfile a little better at some point, but for now
# I don't want to try and mess with it. And the only ordering available in this
# cop is alphabetical, which I don't think is best.
Bundler/OrderedGems: { Enabled: false }

#################### Layout ###########################

# I would like to turn this on, but the exception handling isn't good enough.
# It raises an offense on the first definition that doesn't match the config,
# and although you can disable there, if it is an earlier definition that threw
# it off, there's no way to disable the actual exceptional case.
#
# For example:
#
# has_many :dashboards, through: :packages
#
# # rubocop:disable ClassStructure <-- this disable doesn't help
# has_one :configuration, class_name: 'PracticeConfiguration'
# # Dynamic alias to catch method override below
# def practice_configuration # <-- out of order definition
#   configuration
# end
# # rubocop:enable ClassStructure
#
# delegate :time_zone, to: :source # <-- offense raised here
#
# We'll want to keep an eye on this and see if it gets more capable over time.
